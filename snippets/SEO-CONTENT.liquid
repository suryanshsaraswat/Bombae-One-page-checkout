    <ul>Frequently Asked Questions
      <li>Q. How many times in a day can I use vitamin C+ face wash ?
        A. We recommend using the face wash two times a day i.e. morning and night.</li>
      <li>Q. Does hair grow back thicker post shaving?
        A. It is not true that shaving makes your hair grow back thicker. Shaving has no impact on hair growth. Unlike waxing which pulls hair from the roots, a razor cuts the hair from the middle of the growth, and thus it feels like the hair is growing sharper and thicker but it is not the case.</li>
      <li>Q. Which one is better for removing facial hair: a trimmer or a razor?
        A. Ideally both of them serve a different purpose and they are equally effective and designed to minimise the chances of nicks and cuts. For the days when you need a clean look quickly, a trimmer comes in handy while a razor can give you much smoother hair removal experience.
